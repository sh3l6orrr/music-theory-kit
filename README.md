## Introduction

MusicTheoryKit is a Swift framework that provides an easy-to-use API for most commonly used music terms.

Create notes, assemble chords, do maths on notes, and many more to come.
```swift
import MusicTheoryKit

let chord = Chord("Cmaj9/G")!
print(myChord.description)

// This is a slash chord named Cmaj9/G over G, with root note C, and component notes D, E, G, B, 
// which are respectively major second, major third, perfect fifth, major seventh above the root. 
```
```swift
import MusicTheoryKit

Note.D - Note.E  // Interval.m7
```
